  For every point p ‚àà M, there exists an open neighborhood U_p ‚äÜ M and a homeomorphism
  œÜ_p : U_p ‚Üí V_p ‚äÜ ‚Ñù, where V_p is open in ‚Ñù.
  Each V_p ‚äÜ ‚Ñù is a disjoint union of open intervals (by real_class lemma).
  Let I_p be the interval in V_p which contains the point œÜ_p(p) and set W_p = (œÜ_p)‚Åª¬π(I_p).
  Then œÜ_p | W_p : W_p ‚Üí I_p is a homeomorphism onto the open interval I_p.
  Every open interval in ‚Ñù is homeomorphic to ‚Ñù so W_p ‚âÉ‚Çú ‚Ñù.
  By contruction, {W_p : p ‚àà M} is an open cover of M and by compactness, there exists a
  finite subcover {W_{p_i} : i ‚àà {1, ..., n}}, where each W_{p_i} ‚âÉ‚Çú ‚Ñù. ‚àé
